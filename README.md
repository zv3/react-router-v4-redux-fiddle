This is a single page React app that was built as part of a coding challenge which required the implementation and design to follow the provided mockup at the pixel level and the specifications as described.

The technology stack employed consists of React v15 and a few other React libraries like Redux (as state manager) and React Router (for url routing) as well as a charting library (chart.js) to draw the needed pie charts. On the UI design side Zurb's Foundation v6 SASS framework was used as the CSS framework. Facebook's Jest and AirBnb's Enzyme libraries were also used as testing frameworks in a browser environment.

A live demo of the app can be viewed [here](http://dzv3.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sfe-crossover-test/).
